# Changelog

## v0.30.0

Refactored iOS to use shared component from sentry-cocoa.
Also squashed many little bugs on iOS.

- Fixed #281
- Fixed #280

## v0.29.0

- Fixed #275
- Fixed #274
- Fixed #272
- Fixed #253

## v0.28.0

We had to rename `project.ext.sentry` to `project.ext.sentryCli` because our own proguard gradle plugin was conflicting with the name.
The docs already reflect this change.
- #257

We now use the `mainThread` to report errors to `RNSentry`. This change is necessary in order for react-native to export constants.
This change shouldn't impact anyone using `react-native-sentry` since most of the "heavy" load was handled by `sentry-cocoa` in its own background queue anyway.
- #259
- #244

Bump `sentry-cocoa` to `3.8.3`


## v0.27.0

We decided to deactivate stack trace merging by default on iOS since it seems to unstable right now.
To activate it set:

```js
Sentry.config("___DSN___", {
      deactivateStacktraceMerging: false
});
```

We are looking into ways making this more stable and plan to re-enable it again in the future.

## v0.22.0

- Add

```groovy
project.ext.sentry = [
