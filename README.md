**This is a beta release**

*Requirements:*

* `react-native >= 0.38` for iOS
* `react-native >= 0.41` for Android
* `sentry-cli   >= 1.9.0` (`brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-cli`)

With this SDK, Sentry is now able to provide mixed stacktraces. This means that if a JavaScript call causes a crash in native code, you will see the last call from JavaScript before the crash. This also means that with the new SDK, native crashes are properly handled on iOS.

## Additional device information

When using this library you will get a lot more information about the device surrounding your crashes.
